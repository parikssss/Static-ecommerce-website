			<p> In essence, technology is a methodical approach to accomplish tasks or
				resolve issues. Technology is another human endeavor aimed at creating
				items that make life more comfortable for people, such as machinery,
				computers, household appliances, and other items. Technology also refers
				to new ideas, skills, methods, or ways of doing things that can lead to the
				creation of new objects. <br><br> It can also be described as a cultural tradition
				created in human groups for the advancement of the natural world. In fact,
				we use technology to manage the environment in which we live. <br><br>
				
				Technological implementations for the maintenance of bonsai plants. <br><br>
				Pruning<br>
				Branches are pruned with scissors and other tools to adjust the
				shape of the tree. A young bonsai tree being pruned for the first
				time requires particular care, since its basic shape and style will be
				decided then. When the tree gets a little older, branches are cut to
				achieve a better balance, taking into consideration things like the
				direction, density and length of the branches. A tree that is nearly
				fully grown is pruned to maintain its beauty.

			<p> 
				Bonsai plants will expand if nothing is done to stop them. While
				pruning can assist manage a bonsai tree's size, its aim is not to
				prevent it from growing; rather, it is a method for utilizing plants'
				propensity for development to produce aesthetically beautiful
				shapes. The timing and manner of branch cutting varies
				depending on the type of plant. By giving bonsai plenty of sun and
				air, proper trimming can encourage its healthy growth.
				
				<br><br>
				Wiring <br>
				Wiring is used to make a desired turn or straighten an abnormal
				curve; wires are fastened to the trunk and branches. Copper and
				aluminum wires are frequently used; however, aluminum is
				simpler to handle and better for novices. The size and hardness
				of the branch determines which of the more than ten various
				wire thicknesses should be utilized. Although they occasionally
				just cover a tiny portion of the tree that needs to be changed,
				wires are typically wrapped around the trunk and then from the
				lower to the upper branches. When the wires are left on for an
				extended period, they may begin to bite into the growing
				branches and harm the plant. Before this occurs, bonsai growers
				must take care to remove the wiring. A tree's trunk and branches
				may be wired again if the desired effect isn't realized.

			<p> Positive impacts of technology
				Modern technology is the era in which we live. Education,
				communication, healthcare, agriculture, and social and personal life are
				all strongly impacted by technology. Technology has advantages and
				disadvantages just like everything else, yet we simply cannot manage
				without it. Consequently, it is essential that we use technology to enrich
				our life. <br><br>
				Some of the positive impacts of technology are mentioned below.<br>
				<ol style = "font-size: 19px; line-height: 130%;">
				<li>Technologies are employed in the field of healthcare and
				medical research.</li>
				<li>Technology Has Enhanced Knowledge Available to Us.</li>
				<li>Technology Has Expanded Personal Productivity.</li>
				<li>Technology supports trade and business.</li>
				<li>Environmental studies advance thanks to technology.</li>
				</ol> 
			</p>
				
				<p>
				Negative impacts of technology. <br>
				Technology has both beneficial and harmful impacts. There is no
				doubting that technology has considerably bettered our lives. However,
				it has some adverse effects that materially affect our lives. These
				negative impacts must not be disregarded. These are things we need to
				be conscious of.
				
				<ol style = "font-size:19px; line-height: 130%;">
					<li>Reduced level of movement.</li>
					<li>A constant source of distraction is technology.</li>
					<li>Technology burns more energy.</li>
					<li>Technology makes people less empathetic.</li>
					<li>Resources Running Out</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Impacts of technology while selling Bonsai plants.<br>
					
					Technology advancements have made it easier to plant, harvest, and
					even sell bonsai plants. The effects of technological transformation on
					the sales industry have been especially evident. Modern salesperson act
					in a very different way from their ancestors. They face new obstacles and
					have access to new materials, methods, and tools for bonsai plants.<br>
					
					Some of the impacts that technology have made while selling Bonsai
					plants are given below:
					
					
					<ol style="font-size:19px; line-height: 130%;">
						<li>The Capability to Identify, Assess, and Connect with Buyers globally.</li>
						<li>The ability to find almost any piece of information The capacity to sell anywhere you go.</li>
						<li>From a sustainability standpoint, technology evaluation for system sales is still in its infancy.</li>	
						<li>The development of technologies on a worldwide scale that are used for sales but influence sustainability outside of agriculture is on the rise.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
						Overall conclusion: <br><br>
						
						Technological change has been the measure driving force for
						increasing selling productivity and promoting the development of
						agriculture. The choice of technologies and their adoption was to
						increase the production, vend and generate income. The concept
						of technology has contributed to the overall welfare for agriculture.
						Its impact is economically efficient and profitable, socially
						responsible, while it also improves environmental quality.
